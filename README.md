How to work with JavaScript projects

## ESLint
+ [Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code - ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript Linter](https://eslint.org/) 
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline


## Prettier
+ [Prettier Â· Opinionated Code Formatter](https://prettier.io/)
+ [prettier/prettier: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
 Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
